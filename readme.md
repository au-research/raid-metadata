# RAiD

The Research Activity Identifier (RAiD) provides a unique, persistent identifier (PID) for research projects and activities. RAiD identifies projects and provides storage and retrieval of project information, using an identifier (a DataCite DOI) and an associated metadata record. The RAiD metadata record captures project information for long-term discovery, resolution, access, sharing, reporting, and other uses by the global research community. Complete metadata is stored in the RAiD system, with an excerpt deposited with DataCite when a DOI is minted.

RAiD is developed, maintained, and operated by the [Australian Research Data Commons](https://ardc.edu.au/) (ARDC) in its role as Registration Authority under [ISO 23527:2022](https://www.iso.org/standard/75931.html), in cooperation with DataCite and RAiD Registration Agencies.

This documentation describes the RAiD metadata schema.
